# Project Motivation
Learn basics of React
## Goal
- make a tic tac toe app as they do one in the React documentation, I will be able to correct myself to see how it is done the right way https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe 

## Project Result
At first I made a working tic tac toe but I had issues resetting the game. I I had misunderstood what a pure component was : I was thinking that creating a pure component was something similar to Java (where each classes have their own file). 
I looked at how it was made in the documentation tutorial and realized that 'Lifting state up' and being able to define several components in the same file would be the solution to my problem. I re-started from scratch and made the following tic tac toe : [Tic Tac Toe]()

It was a success, I had learn React basics and used them in my first project.
